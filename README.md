This nextjs app is the front end part of an AI Based bodyfat estimator. It is coupled with a Flask backend that you can find [here](https://github.com/SamyBahi/bodyfat-estimator.api) The web app uses Machine Learning to estimate your density taking your mensurations as an input, and computes your bodyfat according to Siri's formula (1956).

You can find my approach to predicting density from mensurations (that led to the model that is currently used on the backend) on [this notebook](https://github.com/SamyBahi/bodyfat-estimation)

## Getting Started

Install packages :

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
